==============
Press "Start" to begin the game. \n
Catch the stars with the basket. \n
Each star that's caught will increase the score. \n
Each star missed will decrease your lives. \n
When the lives hit 0, your game is over. \n
To replay, click the star. \n

No major glitches, but the stars sometimes go through the side of the basket.
