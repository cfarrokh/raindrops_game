raindrops_game
==============
Raindrops game algorithm:
1. Create a variable that tracks the value of the score as it changes
2. Create an array of raindrops by first creating a raindrop class
3. Create a catcher to catch those raindrops
4. Create a velocity so that one raindrop falls
5. Set the catcher's location to follow the mouse
6. Check to see if the raindrop touches the catcher
7. If the raindrop touches the catcher, the score variable should increase and the raindrop should disappear from that location
8. After the raindrop disappears into the catcher, the next raindrop falls
